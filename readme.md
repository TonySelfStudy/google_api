## Project Name & Summary
*Exploring the Google API*  

This project was developed in an effort to use the google
calendar api.  Along the way, google project id, api authorization,
oauth2 system, and permission tokens were explored.

The project was a success given that I can now use the calendar api
to modify a user's calendars and also was able to get a http server
to listen for google web-hook callback notices when calendar information
was modified.

The project is evolving from scratch code to a more useful form as
side-project time allows ...

## Usage
This app requires my tokens and google access keys that I have not shared
on github.  As such, this code will only run on my machine.

However, you can still review the code for frameworks and core concepts.
